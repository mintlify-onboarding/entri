## Announcing Entri Version 2.1 "Polyglot Taco"
I'm excited to announce the release of Entri 2.1, nicknamed Polyglot Taco.
What's new in Entri Version 2.1?

- Entri now has support for 9 languages! To load Entri in a specific language, apply the locale property to the Entri config. See the [API Reference](/api-reference) for more information. Supported languages include: `en`, `es`, `pt`, `fr`, `it`, `de`, `nl`, `pl`, `tr`
- We added support for a variety of advanced customizations, enabling our enterprise clients to further customize the Entri modal to match their own brand. Want to apply this to your account? Contact your account manager today.
