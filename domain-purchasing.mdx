With Entri Sell, your users can buy and connect a domain name to your application effortlessly, right within your Entri modal. After purchase, Entri automatically connects their domain to your service, applying the records you defined on the `dnsRecords` object.

#### Step 1 - Configure Entri

To set up Sell, first [configuring Entri](/docs/install).

Be sure to use the [dynamic configuration variables ](/docs/install#dynamic-configuration-variables-based-on-the-user-inputted-domain)if your DNS records change based on the domain purchased.

#### Step 2 - Call purchaseDomain()

Then, call the `purchaseDomain` method with your configuration object to open the Entri Purchase Domain Flow.

<CodeGroup>

```HTML HTML/Vanilla
<button type="button" onclick="entri.purchaseDomain(config)">Purchase Domain</button>
```

```jsx JSReact/JSX
<button type="button" onClick={() => entri.purchaseDomain(config)}>Purchase Domain</button>
```

</CodeGroup>

That's it! You're all set. If you are using [Entri's callback events](/docs/api-reference#onentriclose-callback-event-datalaststatus-fields), the `setupType` will be set to `purchase`. 

```JavaScript JavaScript
{  
  domain: "purchased-domain.com",  
  success: true,  
  setupType: "purchase",  
  provider: "Ionos",  
  lastStatus: "FINISHED_SUCCESSFULLY",  
}
```

#### Advanced Settings

Entri Sell has the following additional parameters you can apply to the `config` object that may be useful depending on your needs. 

| Property       | Type    | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| disableConnect | boolean | No       | false   | If true then the flow will only run the domain(s) purchase flow, but no specific DNS records will get configured.                                                                                                       |
| debugMode      | boolean | No       | false   | For testing purposes. It skips the actual domain purchase flow and checkout and takes the user back to the DNS records setup step. **IMPORTANT!**: this should only be used with pre-existent IONOS registered domains. |
| freeDomain     | boolean | No       | false   | This feature allows you to offer your users their first domain at no cost. Please contact your account manager to enable this feature                                                                                   |
