Welcome to Entri! 👋 

## ℹ️ About us

Our mission is to unlock the internet for everyone.

Domains are the backbone of the internet. Yet, configuring them for applications is a cumbersome task for both application developers and their end users. 

Entri takes the hassle out of custom domains through its suite of APIs: Connect, Power, Sell, and Secure.
